# Iff it was specified as component we require it.
# Else if we built with it we try to find it quietly.
# The latter part is to provide backwards compatibility as a simple finding of
# Phonon would also drag in experimental. To simulate this we'll look for it
# silenetly while not failing if it was not found. Ultimately it was the
# config consumer's responsibility to check if experimental was actually found.
# So nothing changes there. Config consumers can however now use it as a
# component to force an error when it isn't available.
